Shell scripts I did for fun and learning purposes:

# waiting42.sh:

**prerequisites:** 
- a terminal where you can execute shell scripts;
-  the recommended monospaced font: come to https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts, and figure out how to install the iMWritingDuoSpaced Regular Nerd Font;
- or any other font that will make the poem display as an almost perfect square in your terminal;

**how-to:**
 - just execute the script and read a cute poem;

# turns_battle.sh
